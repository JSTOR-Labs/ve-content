# Kent seaside resorts

As the fashionable ‘water cure’ of spas such as Bath and Tunbridge Wells moved coastwards in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, so a number of obscure fishing villages reinvented themselves as seaside resorts. Kent was an obvious beneficiary of this trend, with Gravesend in the Medway area and no fewer than seven resorts along the East coast: while Whitstable and Herne Bay never offered serious competition to the Sussex resorts of Brighton and Eastbourne, visitors were drawn in large numbers to [Broadstairs](#broadstairs), [Ramsgate](#ramsgate) and [Margate](#margate) in Thanet, and to [Folkestone](#folkestone) and [Dover](#19c-dover) in Sheppey.

Women of all ages benefited from the greater freedom and healthier lifestyle of the seaside holiday. Princess Victoria spent three months in Broadstairs in 1829 and stayed in Ramsgate in 1835. Another teenage girl, Emily Shore, kept a journal of her visit to Thanet in the summer of 1831. Like Anna Maria Hussey, who holidayed in Dover in 1836, Emily made the trip by steamboat.

By the early decades of the 20th century visitors would be able to enjoy a body of holiday fiction set in the resort they were visiting: _Maggie of Margate: a Seaside Sensation,_ _The Passenger to 'Folkestone_, _The Beauty of Broadstairs_ and _A Girl of Thanet_, to name but a few.

## Broadstairs

Broadstairs is a coastal town on the Isle of Thanet in the Thanet district of east Kent, England, about 80 miles (130 km) east of London. It is part of the civil parish of Broadstairs and St Peter's, which includes St Peter's, and had a population in 2011 of about 25,000. Situated between Margate and Ramsgate, Broadstairs is one of Thanet's seaside resorts, known as the "jewel in Thanet's crown". The town's coat of arms's Latin motto is Stella Maris ("Star of the Sea"). The name derives from a former flight of steps in the chalk cliff, which led from the sands up to the 11th-century shrine of St Mary on the cliff's summit.

Despite being the favoured holiday destination of no less a figure than [Charles Dickens](https://kent-maps.online/dickens/dickens-biography), [Broadstairs](https://warnerbros.digitalpigeon.com/msg/CDUQoLnGEeqC8wbfE8cnCQ/VdDOxM7Jm4sxoAAhNTQ1ZQ) never aimed to compete with either the much-vaunted gentility of Ramsgate or the mass appeal of Margate. In 1831 the teengage diarist [Emily Shore](https://kent-maps.online/19c/19c-shore-biography) recorded her mother's obvious disappointment at the lack of social amenities and for most of the century it kept out less elegant tourists by the simple expedient of ‘failing to provide facilities which would attract them – no public amusements or music halls. Just a small circulating library with old-fashioned assembly room attached, calculated to attract a steady flow of quiet respectable visitors.’  One journalist commented with patronising approval in 1864 that ‘Broadstairs is a quaint old place, and its inhabitants are still very primitive.’

The town spreads from Haine Road in the west to Kingsgate (named after the landing of King Charles II in 1683), a hamlet in St Peter parish in the north, and to Dumpton in the south (named after the yeoman Dudeman who farmed there in the 13th century). The hamlet of Reading (formerly Reden or Redyng) Street was established by Flemish refugees in the 17th century.

## Ramsgate

Ramsgate is a seaside town in the district of Thanet in east Kent, England. It was one of the great English seaside towns of the 19th century. In 2001 it had a population of about 40,000. Ramsgate’s main attraction is its coastline, and its main industries are tourism and fishing. The town has one of the largest marinas on the English south coast, and the Port of Ramsgate provided cross-channel ferries for many years.

## Folkestone

As one 19th century wag observed, Folkestone is a near anagram of ‘Kent Fools’, a joke not lost on the unknown author (believed to be from [Dover](/dickens/19c-dover)) of [_The Folkestone Fiery Serpent._](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yiotAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP5&lpg=PP5&dq=folkestone+fiery+serpent+first+published&source=bl&ots=FC3-gil3xI&sig=NR_HmDFGyrVpUf5psT-vvLgvK8k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMI9I2TlPmmxwIVsgjbCh146QCT#v=onepage&q=folkestone%20fiery%20serpent%20first%20published&f=false')  While the townspeople in this comic poem are unable to tell the difference between a dragon and a peacock, their real life counterparts were more astute in their promotion of the town.

## Dover

Dover (/ˈdoʊvər/) is a town and major ferry port in Kent, South East England. It faces France across the Strait of Dover, the narrowest part of the English Channel, and lies south-east of Canterbury and east of Maidstone. The town is the administrative centre of the Dover District and home of the Port of Dover. The surrounding chalk cliffs are known as the White Cliffs of Dover.

Archaeological finds have revealed that the area has always been a focus for peoples entering and leaving Britain. The name derives from the River Dour that flows through it.

The Port of Dover provides much of the town's employment, as does tourism.
