# Amorphophallus titanum

Amorphophallus titanum, the titan arum, is a flowering plant with the largest unbranched inflorescence in the world. The talipot palm, Corypha umbraculifera, has a larger inflorescence, but it is branched rather than unbranched. A. titanum is endemic to Sumatra.  Due to its odor, like that of a rotting corpse, the titan arum is characterized as a carrion flower, and is also known as the corpse flower or corpse plant (Indonesian: bunga bangkaiâ€”bunga means flower, while bangkai can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion). For the same reason, the title "corpse flower" is also attributed to the genus Rafflesia.
